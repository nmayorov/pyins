# pyins

pyins is a Python package which provides common basic algorithms used in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) aided by external sensors like GNSS.

Version 1.0 has refined and improved functionality, consistent docstrings and extended examples.
Refer to [version_1.0.md](./version_1.0.md) for the list of main changes compared to earlier versions.

## Installation

The package now is pure Python and thus can be easily installed on any platform.

### Installing from pypi

Due to pypi policies the distribution package name is "python-ins".
```shell
pip install python-ins
```

### Installing from source

To perform a regular install, execute in the cloned repository directory: 
```shell
pip install .
```
To perform an editable (inplace) install:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

Runtime dependencies include (versions in parentheses were used for the latest development):

* numba (0.58.0)
* numpy (1.25.2)
* scipy (1.11.3)
* pandas (2.1.1)

## Running tests

To run all the supplied tests with `pytest` execute: 
```shell
pytest --pyargs pyins
```
Due to some `pytest` limitations it won't work for the editable installation. 
In this case supply path to `tests` directory:
```shell
pytest /your_dev_dir/pyins/pyins/tests
```
